Here's a **repeatable beginner-friendly workflow** with exact commands:

## 🚀 Complete Beginner Workflow

### Step 1: Save the Script
```bash
# Copy the entire script content and save it as:
nano git-time-machine.sh
```
(Paste the script, then press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter` to save)

### Step 2: Make it Executable
```bash
chmod +x git-time-machine.sh
```

### Step 3: Prepare Your Repository
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Check your current status
git status

# If you have uncommitted changes you want to keep:
git add .
git commit -m "Save current work before restoration"
```

### Step 4: Find Your Target Commit
```bash
# View recent commits to decide which one to restore
git log --oneline -10
```
**Example output:**
```
abc1234 Fix login bug
def5678 Add user profile page  
ghi9012 Update dependencies
jkl3456 Initial commit
```
*Note down the commit hash (first 7 characters like `def5678`)*

### Step 5: Run the Script
```bash
./git-time-machine.sh
```

### Step 6: Follow the Interactive Prompts

**What you'll see and do:**
1. **Script starts** - Shows fancy banner
2. **Pre-flight checks** - Automatically runs ✅
3. **Commit history** - Review the list
4. **Enter commit hash** - Type: `def5678` (your target commit)
5. **Confirm details** - Type: `yes`
6. **Wait** - Script does everything automatically
7. **Dev server starts** - Your project opens automatically 🎉

## 🔁 Repeatable Workflow (Copy-Paste Ready)

```bash
# === ONE-TIME SETUP ===
# 1. Save script as git-time-machine.sh in your project
# 2. Make executable:
chmod +x git-time-machine.sh

# === REPEATABLE WORKFLOW ===
cd /path/to/your/project
git status
git log --oneline -10
./git-time-machine.sh
# Follow prompts - that's it!
```

## 📋 Quick Command Cheat Sheet

```bash
# 🆕 First time setup
chmod +x git-time-machine.sh

# 🔁 Every time you want to restore:
cd /path/to/your/project
git log --oneline -10          # Pick commit hash
./git-time-machine.sh          # Run restoration
# Follow prompts → Done! 🎉
```

## 🛡️ Safety Checklist Before Running

Run these quick checks:
```bash
git status                      # Should be clean or committed
git log --oneline -5           # See recent commits  
git remote -v                  # Check remote connection
```

## 🎯 Example Walkthrough (Real Commands)

```bash
# You're in your project directory
$ pwd
/home/user/my-project

# Check status
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'

nothing to commit, working tree clean

# View commits
$ git log --oneline -5
def5678 Add dark mode theme
abc1234 Fix responsive layout  
ghi9012 Update dependencies
jkl3456 Add user authentication
mno7890 Initial commit

# Run the script
$ ./git-time-machine.sh

# Script shows fancy banner and history
# Prompt: "Enter the commit hash to restore to:"
# You type: abc1234
# Prompt: "Proceed with restoration? (yes/no):"  
# You type: yes

# Wait for magic to happen... ✨
# Script does everything automatically
# Your dev server starts automatically 🎉
```

## 🔄 Recovery Commands (Just in Case)

If something goes wrong, use these:
```bash
# Find your backup tag
git tag -l "backup-before-restore*"

# Restore from backup (use the actual tag name)
git reset --hard backup-before-restore_20240120_154530

# Push to update remote
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when you see:
- ✅ "Restoration completed successfully"
- ✅ "Development server starting..."
- ✅ Your app opens at `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ All files match the older commit state

## 💡 Pro Tips for Beginners

1. **Always run `git status` first** - make sure you're on the right branch
2. **Use `git log --oneline -10`** - pick a commit from this list
3. **Copy-paste commit hashes** - avoid typos
4. **Type `yes` exactly** - when prompted for confirmation
5. **Don't interrupt** - let the script run completely

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

```bash
# If "Permission denied":
chmod +x git-time-machine.sh

# If "Not in git repository":
cd /path/to/your/git/project

# If "Invalid commit hash":
git log --oneline -10  # Use exact hashes from this list

# If push fails, the script will show you the exact command to run
```

This workflow is **designed for beginners** - just follow the commands in order and the script will guide you through the rest! 🚀
